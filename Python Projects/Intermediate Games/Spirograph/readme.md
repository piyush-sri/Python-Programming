# Spirograph Turtle Project
This program allows you to create a spirograph using Python's turtle module. A spirograph is a geometric drawing tool that creates intricate and beautiful patterns. The program uses random module to generate different patterns of the spirograph every time you run the program.

##  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)
- Random module (pre-installed with Python)

##  Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine

2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located

3. Run the following command to start the program:
'''cmd
  python spirograph_turtle.py
'''
4. The spirograph will be drawn on the turtle window. You can close the window once the drawing is complete.

## Customization
You can customize the appearance of the spirograph by changing the following values in the code:

- pen size: turtle.pensize()
- pen color: turtle.pencolor()
- background color: turtle.bgcolor()
- animation speed: turtle.speed()
