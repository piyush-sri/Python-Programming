#print statement is use to print output on the python shell.
#two consecutive print statement will print output in two different lines
#this is because the print statement by default ends with endline "\n"
#For example print("Hello")=====print("Hello",end="\n")
#thats why print statement show output in newline.
print("Hello piyush founder of OneLinerNotes")


#output: Hello piyush founder of OneLinerNotes

print("Please Give a Star to this  Repository")

#now if we execute or run these two python statement we will be getting the result in two sepereate line.
#Output: 
#Hello piyush founder of OneLinerNotes
#Please Give a Star to this Repository

#Also python is case sensitive that is print() and Print() are two different statement
#print("Fork this repository")--- it works fine by giving the output as Fork this repository
#Print("Fork this repository")   ----it will give you NameError in Python
